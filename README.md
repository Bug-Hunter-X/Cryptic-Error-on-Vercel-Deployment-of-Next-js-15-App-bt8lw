# Next.js 15 Cryptic Vercel Deployment Error

This repository demonstrates a strange error encountered when deploying a seemingly simple Next.js 15 application to Vercel. The application itself is minimal, but the deployment process throws a vague error message.

## Reproducing the Issue

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Attempt to deploy to Vercel. The build process should fail with an unclear error.

## Solution

The solution, found in `index.fixed.js`, often involves carefully checking the Next.js configuration and dependencies.  In some cases, a seemingly innocuous change (like removing unnecessary packages) resolves the issue, suggesting a subtle interaction between the build system and the app's dependencies. This particular case was solved by adding a very basic component.
